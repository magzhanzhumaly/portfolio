As part of my thesis work at university, I led a team in developing Urban Transport Sharing (UTS), an app that enables users to rent various types of transport, such as bikes and cars, in urban environments. I served as both the team lead and the sole iOS developer, overseeing the project’s technical direction and ensuring smooth app functionality.

The app utilizes the Mapbox API to display available transport on a map, and it connects to a central database (developed by a teammate) through a REST API, retrieving user information such as balance, name, and available transport options. Additionally, the app features surge pricing to adjust rental costs dynamically based on demand, enhancing user experience and operational efficiency.
